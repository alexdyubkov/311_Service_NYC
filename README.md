Idea of this project:  
1.Analysis of the most problematic non-emergency types of requests and building a prediction model using data from the 311 New York service.


Data:  
1.Can be downloaded from the original database by uncommenting the cell  
2.You can use the same downloaded data as I used. For it, please download 2 files from(links below) to the folder with the main code

Presentation:<br>
1. Can download "311_service.pptx"  from the / of this project
2. Can open from:

How to read the code without downloading:  
Since github is not the best place to upload .ipynb files sometimes it demands some workaround to display it without downloading.  
I used 3'rd party service to display my code, but it brought some non-critical anomalies:  
List of anomalies:     
a)Geo map doesn't shown properly   
b)output result for each cell isn't limited and it brings a lot of unnecessary data   
With these artefacts you can view it from: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alexdyubkov/311_Service_NYC/blob/master/Project_311.ipynb
